# Emotion Recognition from Speech Signals

Emotion recognition from speech signals plays a crucial role in Human-Computer Interaction, encompassing various techniques and methodologies to extract emotions effectively. In this repository, we propose a model designed to identify emotions present in speech, utilizing a combination of signal processing, feature extraction, and classification techniques.

## Overview

The model architecture comprises three main components:

1. **Signal Processing**: Initially, background noise is removed from the speech signals to enhance the quality of input data.

2. **Feature Extraction**: Various parameters such as pitch, speaking rate, and time-frequency patterns are extracted from the pre-processed speech signals. These features serve as inputs for emotion classification.

3. **Classification**: Emotion detection involves classifying the extracted features into one of seven different emotions commonly found in human speech. We experiment with different classifiers including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), and Deep Learning techniques like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).

## Model Evaluation and Training

In this repository, we focus on evaluating and training the model using LSTM and RNN architectures. These recurrent neural network architectures are known for their ability to capture temporal dependencies in sequential data, making them suitable for speech-related tasks.

## Usage

To utilize the model for emotion recognition:

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
2. Preprocess the speech signals to remove background noise.
3. Extract relevant features from the preprocessed signals.
4. Train the model using the provided LSTM and RNN implementations.
5. Evaluate the trained models using appropriate metrics to assess performance.

## Applications

The developed model has versatile applications across various domains including:

- Healthcare: Assessing emotional states for patient monitoring and support.
- Security: Analyzing voice data for sentiment analysis in security-related contexts.
- Psychology: Understanding emotional cues for psychological research and therapy.
- Medicine: Supporting diagnosis and treatment through emotion-aware systems.
- Education: Enhancing learning experiences through adaptive educational platforms.
- Entertainment: Personalizing content delivery based on user emotion recognition.

## Contribution

Contributions to enhance the model's performance, expand its capabilities, or address any issues are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests.
